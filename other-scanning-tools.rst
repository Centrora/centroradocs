Other Scanning Tools

Besides the core Dynamic Scanner, Centrora Security system also integrates some other scan tool which can assist us to thoroughly clean the website and to confirm if the website has been fixed.

Core Directories Scanner

Core Directories Scanner will scan the website to compare the core system files with the original official package. After a scan, it will report the files which are modified, removed, and suspicious compared to the original version.
