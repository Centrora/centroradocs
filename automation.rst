Scheduled Tasks
****************

Centrora Security allows you to setup various scheduled tasks. It simplifies the configurations so you don't have to set cron jobs in the host control panel.

We can create the tasks in the menu ``Scheduled Tasks``.

For the **Scheduled Virus Scanning**, it can be defined as frequent as daily. However, if the website is clean, making it daily is not that necessary. We will recommend to set the scheduled scan as every week.

For the **Scheduled Git Backup**, we recommend setting it to run every 24 hours.
